Jekyll Rocket
----------

A quickstart for building and deploying high performance static websites with Jekyll.  

## Why you should use Jekyll Rocket

We built this set of practices for high performance static websites, and we use it ourselves. We think you should too. It's fast to get started, and you'll deliver stellar performing websites that are pretty darn easy to maintain thanks to Jekyll.  
  
At Trek10, we wanted to upgrade from an overpowered, under utilized and somewhat sluggish Drupal installation. All we needed was a website that was easy to maintain. We also wanted something that showed off the power of Amazon Web Services since that's our thing.  
  
- Easy to Get Started (Batteries Included)
- Complete Setup Instructions
- Delivers Blazing Fast Websites
- Affordable
- Maintainable
- Screencasts

NOTE: _We do recommend that you or your developers have some familiarity with the command line, but you don't gotta be a sysops with a decade of expereince. (Okay... you really just need to be able to copy paste.) Mostly just know how to open your terminal or cmd prompt._  

### Cost Analysis

[TODO] Get cost analysis from Andy.

### Batteries Included

We spent a lot of time thinking, expirementing, and making things as straight forward as possible. Read through the quickstart guide, check out the screencast, even email us for help rocketplatform@trek10.com.  
  
You just have to plug in a few configurations here and there (Don't worry, we even tell you where to get the values for the configs), and away you go.

We even baked in the concept of staging and production websites. Now you can finally work with your team and easily preview work without screwing up your actual site or sending pictures back and forth in email.


### Technolgoies Used

- Development
  - Vagrant
  - Jekyll
  - Various Jekyll Plugins
- Deployment
  - Amazon Web Services (AWS)
    - S3
    - Cloudfront
  - GitHub Pages
  - Wercker (Optional)

### Built on the Shoulders of Kind Giants  

We couldn't have put together this little repository without help from these kickass people and groups:  
  
- Jekyll
- Jekyll Compression
- Jekyll Asset Pipeline
- Bootstrap
  
## Why you shouldn't use Jekyll Rocket
  
You or your developers are not comfortable working with HTML, CSS (or SASS/LESS) and learning some simple logic. (Protip: If your developers aren't comfortable with this or with learning... we suggest you find some new ones before embarking on whatever project it is that brought you to this page.)  
  
You want a full blown content management system with all the bells and whistles. Something that you or your boss can log into a backend and tweak colors and text to your hearts content. Jekyll is not wordpress. If you want crazy fast WordPress, head on over to the awesome folks at WPEngine (This is not a paid plug, they just have stellar service and product).  
  
You don't want a blazing fast website that breaks sound barriers. We get it, you want that classic 1990's 56K modem feel. That's just not something we specialize in right now.  

## QuickStart Guide

Don't like reading boring text (We really tried to make it more entertaining than your average car manual, but we get it.) or confused about which button to click?  
  
Check out our Screencast that covers the full setup and deployment process. Vagrant. AWS. Jekyll. Making your coffee for that late night website editing binge. You get the idea.

## Contributing

We are pretty lax about the guidelines.  
  
If you have a good idea, or want to implementing something yourself, we are pretty open to it.
We only ask that your idea is in the interest of making this project produce a better end result, easier to use, or easier to mantain.  
  
We are open to constructive criticism, and expect that anyone contributing would be as well. It's only together that we can make this better.
